PyRat
- Yet another deep learning library in python -

What this project is:
- self-taught introduction to deep learning by doing (programming)
- focus on code understandability, not efficiency

Why PyRat?
- I see deep neural networks as the computational analogy to a rat brain.
- This library aims to allow you to "poke around"
- Pirates are cool.
