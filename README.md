PyRat: Learn about deep neural nets by poking the (computational) rat's brain.

What is PyRat about
- self-taught introduction to deep learning by doing (both programming and playing around with the models)
- focus on code understandability, not efficiency
- code examples of increasing complexity

Why the name PyRat?
- I see deep neural networks as the computational analogy to a rat brain.
- This library aims to allow you to "poke around"
- Pirates are cool.

In which order should I go through the examples?

The examples follow roughly Geoffrey Hintons online course on deep neural networks. When I last checked, they were all to be found under the following link:
https://www.youtube.com/user/TRUONGMINHANH93/videos

I would suggest the following order:

1. LinearRegression

2. LogisticRegression

3. LogisticRegressionModular (first use of reusable library code)

4. BackPropagation

5. BackPropagationSoftmax
